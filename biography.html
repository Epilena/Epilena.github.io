        <p>I am currently a laboratory manager overseeing 40 plus employees. I have been in the clinical laboratory for almost 20 years. I am trained as an epiemiologist.  I am a leader and a confidant.  
            I am a strong person who is highly motivated and has a zest for life.

        <p> I am embarking on a career change.  The pandemic has brought with it many life changes and changes in my environment.  I look forward to embark on this journey
            and the many adventures ahead. </p>
